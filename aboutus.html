          <h2>Our History.</h2>
      <div class="para">
          <p>Kantipur Collage of Management and Information Technology was established in August 2000 by a group of management educationists and IT Professionals with wide and long years of experience in the field of teaching and education management. Today KCMIT has gone down in the history of education as the first college of the Tribhuvan University to introduce and implement the Bachelor in Information Management program (BIM)

            With a team of very co-operative and enthusiastic IT Experts and dedicated Faculty the ball was set rolling. Soon in 2004 the Bachelor in Business Administration program (BBA) was introduced. Possessing the essential requirements of quality education there was no looking back for KCMIT.

            Ever since its establishment, the objective of KCMIT has been to produce socially responsible, scientifically approached, Management and IT Professionals in the rapidly growing global job market. We have been on the education map for more than two decades and have successfully sent out several batches of students who have carved their careers in different fields in the national and international arenas</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&quot;For men may come and men may go, But I go on forever&quot;</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">How true Lord Tennyson was when he spoke about the brook. When I reflect on these lines, I feel the same applies to KCMIT also. Students have come and gone, but KCMIT stands tall, radiating the warmth to all the family members of the past and present and waiting eagerly to usher the new.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">For about two decade we have moved along steadily and left an imperishable imprint in the history of education, not only as the pioneer college of the BIM Program and a firm up-coming college of the BBA Program, but also in grooming young ladies and gentlemen to face different challenges of the 21st century. Our growth has definitely not been flamboyant, but mature and dignified as year after year, our students have proved themselves in all walks of life &ndash; be it higher studies or the job market &ndash; KCMITians have carved their way through in this world of cut-throat competition. When success stories of our alumni are heard, a sense of gratifying joy envelopes the reigning atmosphere. These laurels which we cherish today are the outcome of the endless effort of the entire college family- the management, faculty, the administrative staff, the domestic staff and the students themselves. Each one has endeavored to elate the position of KCMIT in the education map; surely this is an accomplishment of the team spirit prevalent amongst the college community. Though we have established ourselves as an abode of learning and an institution which cares for the ethical, professional and social growth of the youth, who have taken shelter under our wings, we still have to go a long way to reach the goal we have set before us. Prior to sending out BIM and BBA graduates into the big, wide, world we want to send good human beings who will uplift themselves above all petty bickerings and spread the message of love and understanding to one and all.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">May the Almighty Lord help us in our march towards our goal and lead us from darkness to light.</p>
